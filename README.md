# copilot-self-improvement

A radically simple VS Code extension and MCP tool which provides Github Copilot with the right **instincts** and **conventions** for working with the existing [Instructions Files mechanism](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot) to gradually tune their own behavior throughout development.  

Secure by default, this "prompt as a program" only reads files in the VS Code-configured location(s). No network requests or write operations are performed.
