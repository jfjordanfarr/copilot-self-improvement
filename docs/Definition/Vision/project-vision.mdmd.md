title: "Copilot Self-Improvement Project Vision"
composition-type: "project-vision-overview"
status: "stable"
version: "1.0"
brief: "To enhance GitHub Copilot Agent Mode with project-specific intelligence via a secure, VS Code-native extension."

## 1. Vision Statement

The core vision is to bridge the gap between GitHub Copilot's general-purpose knowledge and the nuanced, often unstated, requirements of individual software projects. The "Copilot Self-Improvement" extension will provide a mechanism for developers to articulate these project-specific directives through specially formatted Markdown files, creating a persistent, local knowledge base that Copilot Agent can consult.

This "self-improvement" refers to Copilot's enhanced ability to adapt its behavior within a given workspace based on these user-provided instructions. The goal is a learning effect where Copilot becomes increasingly aligned with project-specific patterns and requirements over time.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Secure by Design**: All interactions will occur within the VS Code extension sandbox, using official APIs. This represents the most secure form of Meta-Cognitive Prompting (MCP) by avoiding external scripts or unofficial injection techniques. See `[[req-security]]`.
*   **Seamless Integration**: The extension will feel like a natural part of the VS Code and Copilot ecosystem, leveraging the Language Model Tool API for idiomatic integration. See `[[arch-copilot-integration]]`.
*   **Developer Experience**: The process of creating and managing instructions will be simplified through "syntactic sugar"â€”intuitive commands and a clear, consistent file structure. See `[[req-usability]]`.

## 3. Realization

This vision will be realized by fulfilling a set of core functional requirements (`[[req-core-functionality]]`), adhering to a strict file format (`[[req-file-format]]`), and ultimately being published to the VS Code Marketplace (`[[req-publishing]]`). The entire system architecture is detailed in `[[arch-main]]`.
