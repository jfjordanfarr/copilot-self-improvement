unit-type: "non-functional-requirement"
status: "stable"
version: "1.0"
brief: "Defines features to improve the user experience of managing instruction files."
see-also: ["[[csi-project-vision]]"]

The extension should provide "syntactic sugar" to make creating and managing instruction files intuitive and efficient.

```markdown
1.  **Command Palette Integration**: Key actions MUST be available via the VS Code Command Palette (e.g., "Create New Instruction File", "Validate Instruction Files").
2.  **Validation**: The extension SHOULD provide a mechanism to validate the syntax and structure of instruction files, checking for valid YAML frontmatter and the presence of required fields.
3.  **Clear Feedback**: The extension MUST use standard VS Code UI elements (`showInformationMessage`, `showErrorMessage`, `OutputChannel`) to provide clear and consistent feedback to the user about operations and errors.
