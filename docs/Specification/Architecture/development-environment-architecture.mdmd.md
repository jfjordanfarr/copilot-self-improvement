title: "Development Environment Architecture"
composition-type: "development-process-definition"
status: "stable"
version: "1.1" # Minor update to reflect current tooling and practices
brief: "Defines the setup for the development repository, Codespaces, and project scaffolding, reflecting current project state."
see-also: ["[[main-architecture]]", "[[package-json-implementation]]"] # Updated link

A consistent and efficient development environment is crucial. This architecture specifies the use of standard, modern tooling, as already established in the project.

1.  **GitHub Repository**: A standard GitHub repository is used, containing a `.gitignore` suitable for Node.js/TypeScript projects and an MIT `LICENSE` file. (Status: Implemented)
2.  **GitHub Codespaces**: While a `devcontainer.json` could be configured for a cloud-based development environment, the primary development for this minimalist extension can be effectively carried out locally. If Codespaces were to be used, it would specify a current Node.js version (e.g., >=18.x) and pre-install essential extensions like ESLint, Prettier, and GitHub Copilot. (Status: Optional, Not currently implemented)
3.  **Project Scaffolding**: The project structure was initially created using the official Yeoman generator for VS Code (`yo code`), selecting the "New Extension (TypeScript)" option. This provided a standard setup for building, debugging, and testing. (Status: Implemented)
4.  **Key Technologies & Tooling** (as currently used):
    *   **Language**: TypeScript
    *   **Linter**: ESLint (config: `eslint.config.mjs`)
    *   **Testing**: Mocha (as part of VS Code extension test setup), Sinon for mocking/stubbing.
    *   **Module Bundler**: Webpack (configured via `vscode:prepublish` script in `package.json` typically)
    *   **Package Manager**: npm (managing dependencies in `package.json` - see `[[package-json-implementation]]`)
    *   **VS Code API**: Utilized for extension development, particularly `vscode.LanguageModelTool`.
