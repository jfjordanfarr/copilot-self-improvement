title: "Code Quality and Testing Architecture"
composition-type: "quality-assurance-plan"
status: "stable"
version: "1.0"
brief: "Defines the strategies for ensuring the extension is robust and maintainable."
see-also: ["[[arch-main]]"]

## 1. Code Quality

-   **Linter/Formatter**: The project will use ESLint for static analysis and Prettier for automated code formatting to maintain a consistent style.
-   **TypeScript Strict Mode**: The `tsconfig.json` will have `strict: true` enabled to leverage TypeScript's full type-checking capabilities.
-   **Disposable Management**: All disposable resources (commands, listeners, etc.) will be managed via the `context.subscriptions` array to prevent memory leaks.

## 2. Testing Strategy

-   **Unit Testing**: Core logic, especially file parsing (`[[impl-file-handler]]`) and utility functions, will be unit-tested using a framework like Mocha or Jest. `vscode.workspace.fs` will be mocked to provide controlled inputs.
-   **Integration Testing**: The primary method for end-to-end testing will be manual, using the **Extension Development Host** (launched with F5). This allows for setting breakpoints and testing the full interaction with the live Copilot Chat UI.
