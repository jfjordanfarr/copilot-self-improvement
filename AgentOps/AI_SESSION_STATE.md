# AI Session State

## Current Task & Overall Status
**PROJECT COMPLETE.** The extension has been successfully architected to align with the official `mcp-extension-sample`. It now correctly uses the `McpServerDefinitionProvider` API to automatically register a local, standalone MCP server process with VS Code. This approach is robust, requires no manual user configuration, and correctly surfaces the tool to GitHub Copilot.

**Final Architecture:**
*   **`package.json`:** Contributes a `mcpServerDefinitionProviders` entry. The critical `vscode-jsonrpc` package is correctly listed under `dependencies` to ensure it is bundled with the extension for the server's runtime.
*   **`extension.ts`:** On activation, registers a provider that tells VS Code how to run the server (`node out/server.js`) and passes the workspace root and configuration via environment variables.
*   **`server.ts`:** A standalone Node.js process with zero dependencies on the `vscode` module. It listens on `stdio`, responds to `tools/list` and `tools/call` requests, and uses the server-safe `fileHandler.ts`.
*   **`fileHandler.ts`:** A server-safe module using Node.js `fs/promises` to read instruction files.
*   **Build Process:** The `compile` script in `package.json` now correctly includes a `copyfiles` step to ensure `CONVENTIONS.md` is available to the `server.ts` process in the `out` directory. The `launch.json` and `tasks.json` files are configured to use this `npm` script for debugging.

All outstanding issues, including the silent server crash, the perpetual blue refresh icon, and the tool not being visible to Copilot, have been resolved by adopting this official architecture and correcting the dependency scope.

## Plan
**Phase 1 & 2: Complete**

**Phase 3: Final Polish and Publishing**
*   [ ] **Documentation Review:**
    *   [ ] `README.md`: Update with final usage instructions (install, trust workspace, start MCP server).
    *   [ ] `CHANGELOG.md`: Document the architectural journey and final, working state.
*   [ ] **Publishing:**
    *   [ ] Ensure all `[[publishing-requirement]]` items are met.
    *   [ ] Use `vsce package` and `vsce publish` to release to the Marketplace.
