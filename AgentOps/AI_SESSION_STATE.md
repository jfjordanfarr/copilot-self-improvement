## Current Task & Overall Status
**PHASE 1 COMPLETE: ULTRA-MINIMALIST PIVOT & MDMD REALIGNMENT.**
The extension has been successfully refactored to provide a SINGLE Language Model Tool: `copilotSelfImprovement-getInstructionsAndConventions`. This tool lists metadata for existing `*.selfImprovement.instructions.md` files (located in `.github/instructions/`) and informs GitHub Copilot about the conventions for creating and managing these files. GitHub Copilot is now responsible for all actual file reading (full content) and any file writing operations.

All planned MDMD documentation has been updated to be coherent with this ultra-minimalist design and the finalized 5-field model (+ name/uri for the full `InstructionFileEntry`).

**Finalized `InstructionFileEntry` structure (provided by the tool for each file):**
*   `name: string` (original filename)
*   `uri: string` (stringified URI of the file)
*   `filePath: string` (MEASURED: full absolute path)
*   `applyTo: string` (FRONTMATTER: glob pattern, defaults to `'**/*'` if missing/empty)
*   `purpose?: string` (FRONTMATTER: brief description)
*   `title: string` (MEASURED: derived via frontmatter `title` -> 1st H1 -> 1st content line -> filename)
*   `lastModified: string` (MEASURED: ISO 8601 timestamp from file system stats)

**Finalized Frontmatter Conventions (for Copilot to create/write):**
*   **Required:** `applyTo` (glob pattern), `purpose` (string).
*   An optional `title` field can be included in the frontmatter by Copilot, which will then be used by the tool as the primary source for the `title` metadata field.

**Immediate Next Step:** Consider Phase 2 (Polish and Documentation).

## Plan

**Phase 1: Implement Ultra-Minimalist Read-Only Architecture & MDMD Realignment (COMPLETED)**

1.  **Acknowledge New Pivot & Update MDMD Specifications:** [X] (All sub-items completed)
2.  **Refactor Core File Handling Logic (`src/fileHandler.ts`):** [X] (All sub-items completed)
3.  **Refactor Language Model Tool (`src/instructionTool.ts`):** [X] (All sub-items completed)
4.  **Update Extension Entry Point (`src/extension.ts`):** [X] (All sub-items completed)
5.  **Update `package.json`:** [X] (All sub-items completed)
6.  **Update Unit Tests:** [X] (All sub-items completed)
7.  **MDMD Documentation Coherence Review:** [X] All MDMD files reviewed and updated.
8.  **Update `AI_SESSION_STATE.md`:** [X] Document progress and finalized conventions.

**Phase 2: Polish, Final Documentation, and Pre-Publishing Refinements**
*   **User Experience Polish:**
    *   [X] **One-Time Setup Helper Message & Directory Scan Update (Initial Implementation Complete)**:
        *   ~~Modify `readAllInstructionFiles` in `src/fileHandler.ts`~~: ~~Update the function to scan a list of agreed-upon default instruction directory paths (e.g., `.github/instructions/`, `.vscode/instructions/`) relative to the workspace root.~~ (Superseded by dynamic setting)
        *   ~~Implement in `src/extension.ts` (`activate` function)~~: ~~Use `context.globalState.get` to check if a "setup message shown" flag...~~ (Superseded by dynamic setting logic)
    *   [X] **Refine Directory Scan & Setup Message to use `chat.instructionsFilesLocations` VS Code Setting:**
        *   **Modify `readAllInstructionFiles` in `src/fileHandler.ts`**: [X]
            *   Update the function to read instruction directory paths from the `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('chat').get('instructionsFilesLocations')` setting.
            *   Only scan paths that are enabled (value is `true`) in the setting.
        *   **Modify `showOneTimeSetupMessage` in `src/extension.ts` (`activate` function):** [X]
            *   Check if `chat.instructionsFilesLocations` has any active paths configured.
            *   If not, or if no configured paths exist on disk, the informational message should guide the user on configuring this setting, including a button to open it directly (e.g., `command:workbench.action.openSettings?%5B%22chat.instructionsFilesLocations%22%5D`).
            *   The message should still remind users about the `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles` setting.
            *   The message should list the currently configured and active instruction locations if any are found.
            *   Continue to adhere to the Read-Only Contract.
*   **Final Documentation Review & Updates:**
    *   [ ] **`README.md`**: Ensure it comprehensively describes the extension's purpose, the single tool, the 5-field model (clarifying tool-provided vs. Copilot-authored fields), how Copilot interacts with it (reading full content, writing files), and the ultra-minimalist security profile. Add a section on how to verify the extension is working (checking Copilot traces for the tool's JSON output).
    *   [ ] **`CHANGELOG.md`**: Detail the significant pivot to the ultra-minimalist design and the current feature set.
    *   [ ] **Icon**: Prepare a 128x128 pixel icon if one doesn't exist.
*   **Error Handling Review:** Although the codebase is small, briefly review error handling (e.g., in `fileHandler.ts` if `yaml-front-matter` or `fs.stat` were to throw an unexpected error, though current tests cover typical scenarios).
*   **CI/CD (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   [ ] Set up GitHub Actions to run tests (`npm test`) on push/PR.
    *   [ ] Consider adding test coverage reporting (e.g., with `c8` or `nyc`).

**Phase 3: Packaging and Publishing (Placeholder - If pursued)**
*   Ensure all `[[publishing-requirement]]` items are met.
*   Use `vsce package` to create the `.vsix` file.
*   Publish to the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Log
- 2025-06-07 to 2025-06-09: (Previous log entries detailing the pivot and implementation remain)
- **2025-06-11: Phase 1 (Ultra-Minimalist Pivot & MDMD Realignment) Confirmed Complete.** All coding tasks for the pivot are done, and all MDMD documents have been updated for coherence. The extension now correctly provides the `InstructionFileEntry` metadata and `conventions` string to Copilot. Discussed verification methods (unit tests, manual Copilot trace inspection) and the flow of how Copilot uses the provided information to access the actual plaintext instructions in `.md` files. Updated plan to reflect completion of Phase 1 and outline Phase 2 (Polish).
- **2025-06-11 (Afternoon): UX Polish tasks for `fileHandler.ts` (multi-dir scan) and `extension.ts` (one-time setup message) completed based on *predefined* default directories.**
- **2025-06-11 (Correction): Realized that the extension MUST use the `chat.instructionsFilesLocations` VS Code setting for sourcing instruction file paths, not a hardcoded list. Plan updated to refactor the UX polish accordingly.**
- **2025-06-12: Completed refactoring of `src/fileHandler.ts` and `src/extension.ts` to use `chat.instructionsFilesLocations`.** The `readAllInstructionFiles` function in `fileHandler.ts` now correctly reads and processes paths from the VS Code setting. The `showOneTimeSetupMessage` function in `extension.ts` has been updated to check these settings and guide the user appropriately. Cognitive complexity issues in `checkForActiveConfiguredPaths` (in `extension.ts`) were resolved by introducing a helper function `checkAndFormatPath` and simplifying the iteration logic. The UX Polish task for dynamic directory scanning and the setup message is now considered complete.
